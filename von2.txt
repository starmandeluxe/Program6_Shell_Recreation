Von Neumann was the subject of many dotty professor stories.  Von Neumann
supposedly had the habit 
of simply writing answers to homework
 assignments on
the board (the method of solution 
being, of course, 
obvious) when he was asked
how to solve problems.  One time one of 
his students tried to get more helpful
information by asking if 
there was another way to solve the problem.  Von
Neumann looked blank for a moment, 
thought, and then answered, "Yes.".
